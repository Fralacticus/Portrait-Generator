## The Portrait Generator was designed to make creating portraits from the Modern User Interface pack easier and faster, ordinarily you’d have to manually copy the different pieces (Skin, Hair, Accessories, Etc) together in some kind of art software which can be very time consuming, as well as that it’s often hard to tell if the portrait will even look good since without seeing it in action it can be hard to tell. The Portrait Generator is here to fix all these issues by providing a simple tool to make creating and previewing portraits as easy as possible.

## Guide

### –Essentials–
#### At the top of the screen are four dropdowns, each one is for a different part of the portrait (Skin, Eyes, Hairstyle and an optional Accessory), click on any of them to reveal a dropdown, within this dropdown are all the different types you can choose from, the hairstyle dropdown has different hairstyles to choose from, the eyes dropdown has different eye colors, etc.

#### In the center of the screen you’ll see the spritesheet of your portrait with everything you chose from the dropdowns above, at the bottom of the screen you’ll see three animations previewing what your portrait could look like in your game to allow you to more easily tell if you like the portrait you’re making.

### –Saving–
#### Once you’re finished with your portrait it’s now time to save it, to the right of the dropdowns is a button labeled “Save”, clicking that button will open a new menu prompting you to give your portrait a name and select the size you want (Note if no name is provided a name will be given automatically), once both have been set click the “Save Portrait” button at the bottom, after a few seconds a new menu should appear confirming the portrait has been saved, included in that menu is a button which will take you to the exact folder your portrait was saved in, when you’re done in that menu press “Escape” to close it. Congrats, your portrait is now finished and ready to be added to any game!

### –Randomizing–
#### At the center of the dropdowns is a button which when pressed will randomize all dropdowns, this was added to make finding the right portrait easier, instead of having to look through each dropdown and manually pick out which one you like best, you can simply randomize them until you find one you like.

### –The Info Tab–
#### To the left of the dropdowns is a button labeled “Info”, clicking that button will open a new menu containing 6 buttons each pertaining to something different;
#### -The first button is the help button which takes you to this help page you’re currently reading. 
#### -The settings button takes you to a new menu where you can edit the settings of the “Randomize” button so it only randomizes what you want it to.
#### -The Stats button takes you to another menu showing the total amount of portraits you’ve created as well as the total amount of portraits everyone has created total.
#### -The Source Code button takes you to the github page where the source code of this software is stored
#### -The “My Other Work” button takes you to my Itch.io page where you can see all my other projects.
#### -The Saved Portraits button takes you to the folder where your portraits are saved after creating them.

### –Hotkeys–
#### In version 1.5.0 hotkeys were added to make navigating the Portrait Generator easier.
#### Hotkeys include the following:

#### - Open Save popup: "S"
#### - Open Info Popup: "I"
#### - Randomize Portrait: "R"
